#   code

*   `/views` folder is where React / frontend part located.
*   `/` (root) belongs to nodejs / bakend.
*   All API keys and credentials are at `.env` which is at my machine only.
*   All API routes are [here](./controllers/post.js)
    *   Add post is really interesting because, it uploads image to `cloudinary` first and then add data to `mongodb`.
    *   Delete post is also awesome because, it fisrt delete data from `mongodb` and then deletes image from `cloudinary`.
*   all methods to interact with mongodb are [here](./modals/post.js)
    *   it includes add post, get all posts, get post by id, delete post by id.
